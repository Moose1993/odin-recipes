        <h2> Perfect carne asada for any occasion. Soaked for 24 hours in a spicy citrus and soy marinade that ensures your flank steak will be perfectly tender when it comes off the grill.</h2>

        <p>Carne asada is a Mexican dish featuring steak that's marinated in a lime juice and seasonings mixture. It literally translates to "grilled meat," so the steak is traditionally grilled. Whether you serve it as tacos, a salad topping, or simply chow down on the tender, flavor-packed steak by itself, this will be the best carne asada you've ever experienced. A juicy and flavorful carne asada starts with a delicious carne asada marinade. This recipe begins with a 24-hour marinade to allow the flank steak to soak up all the tasty and fresh flavors before grilling.</p>

        <p> Making this carne asada marinade is so easy: Just combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Reserve 1 cup of the marinade for use after the steak is cooked. Then place the pounded out steak in the marinade and let it sit for 24 hours. However, overnight, or even a few hours, in the marinade is better than nothing. After your steak has marinated, pop it on a preheated grill and cook to your preferred doneness. About 5 minutes on each side will yield a medium-rare steak. Pour the reserved marinade over the steak and serve.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/3 cup lime juice</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped canned chipotle pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 pounds flank steak</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano; stir to combine.</li>

        <li>Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the steak is cooked.</li>

        <li>Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</li>

        <li>After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.</li>

        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>

        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>

        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.</li>

        <li>Remove steak from grill and slice across the grain.</li>

        <li>Place on a serving platter and pour the reserved, unused marinade over top. Serve immediately.</li>
